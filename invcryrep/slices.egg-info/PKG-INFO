# Simplified Line-Input Crystal-Encoding System

This software implementes Simplified Line-Input Crystal-Encoding System (SLICES), the first invertible and invariant crystal representation.

It has several main functionalities:
- Encode crystal structures into SLICES strings
- **Reconstruct original crystal structures from their SLICES strings (Text2Crystal)**
- Generate crystals with desired properties using conditional RNN (Inverse Design)

We also provide a codeocean capsule (a modular container for the software environment along with code and data, that runs in a browser), allowing one-click access to guaranteed computational reproducibility of SLICES's benchmark. [[Codeocean Capsule]](https://codeocean.com/capsule/8643173/tree/v1)

## Installation
```bash
pip install slices
#If you're in China and want to speed up the download, you can use this command instead: "pip install slices -i https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple".
```
Please note that this installtion method is intended for Linux operating systems like Ubuntu and CentOS. Unfortunately, SLICES is not directly compatible with Windows or MacOS due to the modified XTB binary was compiled on Linux. To run SLICES on Windows or MacOS, one can run SLICES with docker, referring to [Reproduction of benchmarks and inverse design case study](#reproduction-of-benchmarks-and-inverse-design-case-study).

If "TypeError: bases must be types" occurs when you use SLICES library, then do this:
```bash
pip install protobuf==3.20.0
```
If errors still occur, then you can create a Python 3.9 environment and install slices in this environment: 
```bash
conda create --name slices python=3.9
conda activate slices
pip install slices
```
## Examples
### Crystal to SLICES and SLICES to crystal
Converting a crystal structure to its SLICES string and converting this SLICES string back to its original crystal structure. 
Suppose we wish to convert the crystal structure of NdSiRu (mp-5239,https://next-gen.materialsproject.org/materials/mp-5239?material_ids=mp-5239) to its SLICES string and converting this SLICES string back to its original crystal structure. The python code below accomplishes this:
```python
from invcryrep.invcryrep import InvCryRep
from pymatgen.core.structure import Structure
# obtaining the pymatgen Structure instance of NdSiRu
original_structure = Structure.from_file(filename='NdSiRu.cif')
# creating an instance of the InvCryRep Class (initialization)
backend=InvCryRep()
# converting a crystal structure to its SLICES string
slices_NdSiRu=backend.structure2SLICES(original_structure) 
# converting a SLICES string back to its original crystal structure and obtaining its M3GNet_IAP-predicted energy_per_atom
reconstructed_structure,final_energy_per_atom_IAP = backend.SLICES2structure(slices_NdSiRu)
print('SLICES string of NdSiRu is: ',slices_NdSiRu)
print('\nReconstructed_structure is: ',reconstructed_structure)
print('\nfinal_energy_per_atom_IAP is: ',final_energy_per_atom_IAP,' eV/atom')
# if final_energy_per_atom_IAP is 0, it means the M3GNet_IAP refinement failed, and the reconstructed_structure is the ZL*-optimized structure.
```
### Augment SLICES and canonicalize SLICES
Converting a crystal structure to its SLICES string and perform data augmentation (2000x), then reduce these 2000 SLICES to 1 canonical SLICES with get_canonical_SLICES.
```python
from invcryrep.invcryrep import InvCryRep
from pymatgen.core.structure import Structure
from pymatgen.analysis.structure_matcher import StructureMatcher, ElementComparator
# obtaining the pymatgen Structure instance of Sr3Ru2O7
original_structure = Structure.from_file(filename='Sr3Ru2O7.cif')
# creating an instance of the InvCryRep Class (initialization)
backend=InvCryRep(graph_method='econnn')
# converting a crystal structure to its SLICES string and perform data augmentation (2000x)
slices_list=backend.structure2SLICESAug(structure=original_structure,num=2000) 
slices_list_unique=list(set(slices_list))
cannon_slices_list=[]
for i in slices_list_unique:
    cannon_slices_list.append(backend.get_canonical_SLICES(i))
# test get_canonical_SLICES
print(len(slices_list),len(set(cannon_slices_list)))
# 2000 SLICES generated by data augmentation has been reduced to 1 canonical SLICES
```
